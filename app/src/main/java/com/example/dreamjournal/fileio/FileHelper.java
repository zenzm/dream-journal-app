/**
 * This class handles File IO for Android apps
 *
 * IO = Input/Output
 * Input = when your program reads data form a file stored on the android device
 * Output = when your program writes data from your app, to a file on the android device
 *
 * In order to connect to a file on the device's hard drive:
 * You must use a Stream object.
 * Think of a stream as a connection between your app, and the file that you are working with.
 * It allows you to transfer data, just like a stream throughout history has allowed humans to transfer goods.
 * So you need a stream object in order to connect your app to a file on the device's hard drive.
 *
 * Streams are NOT JUST for connecting to files.
 * You can use streams to connect to another computer, or a peripheral device, such as a keyboard, or printer.
 * So, streams come in many variations (there are many subclasses of the Stream class in Java).
 * Most of the sub classes are designed to be WRAPPERS around other stream objects.
 *
 * What if we wanted to save the file in a BINARY format, rather than as text
 * (after all, the computer would prefer binary!)?
 *
 * We'll just stick to text for now, but it's not much of a stretch to save your data in a binary format.
 *
 * But HOW ARE WE GOING TO FORMAT THIS TEXT DATA that we wish to save...what type of text)?
 * CSV?
 * XML?
 * JSON?
 * We have some choices (.csv files are everywhere - .xml used to be the king, - but now everyone uses .json)
 *
 * But we are getting ahead of ourselves...before we start worrying the the format of the text, lets just try to work with any text
 * Then, once that's working we can worry about which format the text will be.

     * It is a static method, so you do not need to create an instance of this class in order to call the method.
     *
     * One of the parameters that you will see in this class is a Context object.
     * In Android, the OS (operating system) likes to keep track of which app/activity is trying to access the devices hard drive.
     * Note that the Activity class is a subclass of Context, so an activity object can be used as a parameter that calls for a Context
     * (because an activity object IS-A context object.
     *
     * @param filePath      The path to the file to be created/written (RELATIVE TO WHERE?)
     * @param data          The data to be written into the file
     * @param context       The Android OS likes to know which activity is reading/writing to the devices harddrive.
     *                      (Remember, an activity object IS-A context)
     * @return              Returns true the the file write completed successfully, false otherwise
